## üêõ Known Issues

#### Mock API

The mock API throws `CORS` error. Therefore, I've mocked the APIs using promises and timeout. I have commented the API code for demontstration purpose.

#### Resend button

The `resend otp` button appears after countdown is over. But it does not perform any action on click.
